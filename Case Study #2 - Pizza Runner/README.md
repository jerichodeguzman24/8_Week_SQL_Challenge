* The customer_orders table consists of individual pizza orders, with each row representing a unique pizza.
* Key columns in the table are pizza_id, exclusions, and extras.
* Before utilizing the data for queries, the exclusions and extras columns require a data cleaning process to ensure accuracy and consistency.
* Data cleaning involves handling missing or null values in the exclusions and extras columns.
* The ingredient_id values in the exclusions and extras columns need to be standardized for uniformity.
* Inconsistencies and duplicates in the exclusions and extras data should be resolved to eliminate ambiguities.
* By performing thorough data cleaning, the customer_orders table will be optimized for effective analysis.
* The cleaned data will provide valuable insights into customer preferences, enabling better decision-making for Pizza Runner's operations.
* With accurate data, Pizza Runner can efficiently meet customer demands and deliver an enhanced pizza ordering experience.
