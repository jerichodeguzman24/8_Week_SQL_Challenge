# 8_Week_SQL_Challenge

This repository serves as a comprehensive solution for the #8WeekSQLChallenge, encompassing eight distinct case studies.The repository is a testament to my prowess in SQL, as it demonstrates my adeptness in solving diverse SQL challenges and showcases my expertise in query composition and problem-solving. These case studies cover a wide array of topics, including ranking, common table expressions (CTEs), datetime functions, text manipulation, aggregation, NULL handling, and more.
This repository reflects the culmination of my journey through various SQL challenges. Each case study presents a unique problem-solving scenario that required me to apply a range of SQL techniques such as CTEs, case statements, date functions, and complex aggregations. As a result, I have honed my skills in SQL query crafting, data manipulation, and analysis.

Through this repository, I proudly present my ability to tackle intricate SQL challenges and exemplify my aptitude for effectively addressing real-world data scenarios. It serves as a testament to my growth, proficiency, and innovation in the realm of SQL.
The creator behind the development of the #8WeekSQLChallenge is Danny Maa.
